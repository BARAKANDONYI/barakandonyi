## Challenges and How I Solved Them

- **Making the Forms User-Friendly**  
  Some fields were being left blank or filled in wrong. I added JavaScript validation to make sure important fields (like email) were filled out properly before allowing submission.

- **Building a Responsive Layout**  
  The layout looked broken on smaller screens at first. I used Flexbox and media queries in CSS to adjust the layout based on the screen size so everything stays clean and readable.

- **Using Different Form Inputs**  
  I needed to include radio buttons, checkboxes, and text areas. Lining them up properly and making sure they worked together took some fine-tuning, but I got it working smoothly using standard HTML and some JavaScript tweaks.

## Current Status

The front-end is complete and ready to be connected to a back-end system in the future. It’s ideal for churches that want to digitize their records and streamline basic operations.
